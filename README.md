This is my personal project for the soundscape assignment.
My soundscape attempts to take the listener through a run in pittsburgh, using sounds consistent with the area to make it clear where you are. You begin in South Oakland, head to Shenley Park, cut through campus and finally head back through South Oakland to get home.
