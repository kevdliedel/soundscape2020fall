In my first send-in of the soundscape I added the sound of a door opening/closing, the sound of birds chirping, and music that I intend to play at a low volume throughout the run. They aren't placed yet in their correct place in the soundscape. I used this to figure out how to import sounds and collect them from myself and from other sources.
